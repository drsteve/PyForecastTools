A Python module to provide model validation and forecast verification tools.
The module builds on the scientific Python stack (Python, Numpy) and uses
the dmarray class from SpacePy's datamodel.

SpacePy is available through the Python Package Index, MacPorts, and is under
version control at [sourceforge.net/p/spacepy/](https://sourceforge.net/p/spacepy)
If SpacePy is not available a reduced functionality implementation of the class
is provided with this package.

PyForecastTools is available through the Python Package Index and can be installed
simply with

> pip install PyForecastTools --user

To install (local user), run

> python setup.py install --user

After installation, the module can then be imported (within a Python script or 
interpreter) by

> import verify

For help, please see the docstrings for each function and/or class.

Additional documentation is under development using Github pages at [drsteve.github.io/PyForecastTools](https://drsteve.github.io/PyForecastTools), and source for this is in the [docs folder](docs/).
